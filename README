Uniconsolata is a version of Inconsolata by Raph Levien which aims to increase the Unicode coverage of the exquisite Inconsolata typeface. It builds on Inconsolata Hellenic by Dimosthenis Kaponis, which added Greek glyphs to the font.

Like its parent fonts, Uniconsolata is licensed under the Open Font License by SIL. (http://scripts.sil.org/OFL).
